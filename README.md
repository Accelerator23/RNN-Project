# RNN-Project
Abstract

This academic paper scrupulously explores the feasibility of advanced deep learning
algorithms, particularly the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), for the prognostication of
corporate defaults. The primary function of these neural architectures is to formulate a
prediction concerning the prospect of a corporation's bankruptcy within one year. This
prediction leverages a five-year historical financial data of approximately 40,000 companies,
their market performance metrics, and macroeconomic indicators. The fundamental
ambition of this investigation is to ascertain the optimal configuration for such a task and to
critically evaluate the suitability of RNNs for such a challenging application.


I. Introduction

*Objective*
This scholarly composition aims to meticulously evaluate the efficacy of Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs) in predicting the likelihood that a company will default within the span of a
year with a commendable degree of precision. The challenge of forecasting a company's
bankruptcy is a critical issue in finance and the pursuit of an effective solution is crucial in all
types of financial decision-making processes.
Our objective is to ascertain whether Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) serve as a suitable
methodology for this issue. To achieve this, it is imperative that we construct, test, and
subsequently refine an RNN architecture to generate the highest accuracy with the lowest bias
for each class.
If our outcomes are positive and trustworthy, we still need to run thorough and rigorous tests
before we make an unequivocal affirmation that an RNN deep learning model has higher
superiority over the capability of humans at answering this question of prognostication of a
corporationâ€™s default. Moreover, the need still prevails to determine that the employment of such
a profound and costly learning model is, indeed, economically justifiable in fulfilling the targeted
objective.

*Methodology*
The methodology employed in this paper encompasses three principal aspects: the compilation
of the dataset, the construction of a conceptual model, and the derivation of predictive models.
The process of training and evaluating a deep learning model necessitates an extensive amount
of data. The invaluable data we utilize for this purpose is graciously obtained from Professor
Antonio Rivela Rodriguez. This substantial trove of information has been mined by his
exceptional previous students, Juan Pablo Bonfrisco Ayala and Javier de Vicente Moreno, from
the Bloomberg database. As scholars Junze and Zhe, we fully take advantage of using this
carefully curated dataset and implement certain modifications to the data. The specific details of
these adjustments will be explained in the subsequent sections of this document.
Throughout the process of creating a conceptual model, we have enjoyed the experience of
perusing and understanding a wealth of informative academic publications by pioneering figures
like Bai, Yuhan, and Bengio. Our methodology is to assimilate and comprehend the critical
components of neural networks, including diverse layers, activation functions, regularization
techniques, and a set of hyperparameters. We believe that such an investment of time and effort
is instructive in the creation of a coherent and justifiable conceptual model that aligns with our
objectives. As we traverse this process, we obtained a profound comprehension of a Recurrent
Neural Network (RNN) model and understood its efficacy in predicting corporate defaults.
In pursuit of the optimal model that would best meet our objectives, we created five candidate
models and engaged in over 1,000 iterations, designed to reduce the models' uncertainties.
Although such an endeavor is costly and time-consuming, we assert that this level of
commitment was a necessary sacrifice to achieve our goal, which is not trivial and superficial to
humanity. Our confidence in the predictive models is cemented by the results derived from
Monte Carlo Simulations. It is our aspiration that our diligence will yield meaningful results and
contribute to the application of deep learning models for the financial market.


II. Data Description

*Basic Information*
The dataset employed in this paper is credited to previous efforts of students working in the
same subject, which is time series data consisting of 28 attributes (Financial, Market, and
Stock), 5 consecutive years of 39,536 companies1
(396 bankrupt and 39140 healthy) data
sourcing from Bloomberg.
